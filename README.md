## Feline Lentivirus Extension to Lentivirus-GLUE

<img src="md/puma-droplet.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="200" />

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE-FIV**: an extension to **[Lentivirus-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE)**.

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus that infects domestic and wild cats, causing an immune deficiency syndrome similar to human HIV/AIDS. First identified in the 1980s, FIV primarily spreads through bite wounds and is found worldwide, particularly in feral cat populations. The virus targets immune cells, leading to a gradual decline in immune function over time. While infected cats may live many years without severe symptoms, they become more susceptible to secondary infections. Comparative studies of FIV and other lentiviruses, including HIV, provide insights into viral evolution, immune evasion, and potential pathways for therapeutic intervention.

This extension incorporates all published sequence data from feline lentiviruses, linked to associated metadata, including information that is sequence-associated (length, publication date); taxonomic (viral genotype, subtype); and isolate-associated (isolation host species, date and location of sampling, isolation source).
