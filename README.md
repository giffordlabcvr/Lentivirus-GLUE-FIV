<img src="md/puma-droplet.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="280" />

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE-SRLV**: an extension to **[Lentivirus-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE)**.

This extension incorporates all published sequence data from feline lentiviruses, linked to associated metadata, including information that is sequence-associated (length, publication date); taxonomic (viral genotype, subtype); and isolate-associated (isolation host species, date and location of sampling, isolation source).

## Data Sources

Lentivirus-GLUE-Feline is constructed using sequence data obtained from [NCBI Nucleotide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore).
